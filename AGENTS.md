# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (and other coding agents) for working on
the Autopilot codebase.

## Mandatory Preflight (Before Any Planning or Implementation)

Always read the following documents before you start planning or making changes:

1. `docs/README.md`
2. `docs/overview.md`
3. `docs/runbook.md`
4. `docs/chain-spec.md`
5. `docs/ai-interactive-console.md`

## Working Directory vs Code

`AUTOPILOT_DIR` is the working directory (queues/results/profiles), not the code
path. The code can live anywhere (for example `~/autopilot`), while each project
uses its own `AUTOPILOT_DIR`.

## When Working From Another Project

If you are running Autopilot from a different project repo, ensure that project
has its own `AGENTS.md` referencing the Autopilot docs above and that it defines
`AUTOPILOT_DIR` for that project.
